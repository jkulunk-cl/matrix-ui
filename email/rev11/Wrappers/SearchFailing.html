[ToString({AgentFullName})],

Your prospect Auto Email notification for [(ToString({name_first}))] [(ToString({name_last}))] has automatically been deactivated because of persistent errors while trying to process the search. The most likely cause is search criteria that is too complex.  Please go to your Saved Search under the "My Matrix" tab to revise your search and re-activate Auto Email.  If needed, you can set up more than one search for a single client.  If you need help, please contact Answerlinx support at 866-776-0661.
